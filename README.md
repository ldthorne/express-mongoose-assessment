This is a review session for the express/mongoose assessment

Okay guys, here's what you do:
1) `npm install` to get all your packages installed (or `npm i` if you wanna be lazy)
2) `node seed` to run Sam's seed file. Don't worry about how it works (though if you want to take a look, go ahead! It should be perfectly legible to you)
3) Make stuff. Add on. Kill Amazon with your new store.

Have fun.
Lots of love
- Your fellows.
